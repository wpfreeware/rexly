#Support Questions

We don't answer support questions here on GitHub. Support is available on our [official forum](https://www.wpfreeware.com/support-forums/forum/rexly/).

#Contributing

The development branch is always ahead of the master branch. For that reason, we don't accept Pull Requests against master, as that branch is generally outdated.

When you fork the repo, you'll have access to all the branches, so you would just create a new branch off of development, make your changes, commit, then submit that branch as the Pull Request.
